## üöÄ How to Use New Features

### File Transfer

- **Chunk validation**: Each chunk verified before assembly
- **Size verification**: File size checked after assembly
- **Detailed error logging**: Checksum mismatches logged with both values

---

## üìä Technical Details

### File Transfer Protocol
```
1. Mac sends: fileTransferInit
   - transferId, fileName, fileSize, totalChunks, checksum (SHA-256)

2. Android receives chunks: fileChunk
   - transferId, chunkIndex, data (Base64)

3. Mac sends: fileTransferComplete
   - transferId

4. Android verifies:
   - All chunks received
   - File size matches
   - SHA-256 checksum matches
   - Saves to Downloads folder
```

### Checksum Calculation
- Algorithm: SHA-256
- Format: Hex string (64 characters)
- Calculated incrementally during file read
- Verified on completion
